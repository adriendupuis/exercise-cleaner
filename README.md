Install
-------

To quickly install Exercise Cleaner's phar asset:
- Download last release's asset *exercise-cleaner.phar* from [Releases page](https://github.com/adriendupuis/exercise-cleaner/releases) to your project;
- Make it executable for yourself with `chmod u+x exercise-cleaner.phar`;
- Check executability, for example from same directory, with `./exercise-cleaner.phar --version`.


Usage
-----

The Exercise Cleaner is used to prepare exercises' worksheets (code with missing parts that trainees must fill, the exercise itself) or their solutions.

The Exercise Cleaner mainly cleans code between tags of current and next steps. The Exercise Cleaner can execute several actions on previous steps' code (keep it, comment it, remove it). When preparing an exercise's worksheets, code can be replaced by placeholders (instruction, references, clues, etc.).

### Tags

Tags can be added in exercises' files and the Exercise Cleaner's command will treat what's inside.

The tags include a step number as an integer or a float.

The command get a step as an argument and will remove content inside tags having a greater one. When it's equal or smaller, see details in below subsections.

The command get paths as arguments; for each given folder, the script will first search recursively for files containing `TRAINING EXERCISE START STEP`, the core part of a starting tag.

A tag doesn't care if is embed in a comment or something else. When matching, the whole line containing the tag becomes the tag. For examples comment doesn't exist in JSON, there is some tricks to not trigger syntax errors but with a limitation for last line without ending comma.

#### Simple Tag

- `TRAINING EXERCISE START STEP <step_number>`
- `TRAINING EXERCISE STOP STEP <step_number>`

When `<step_number>` is **greater than** the wanted step number, **remove** inside content.

When `<step_number>` is **equal to** the wanted step number:
* **remove** inside content from **exercise**;
* **keep** inside content into **solution**.

When `<step_number>` is **smaller than** the wanted step number, **keep** inside content.

#### Single Afterward Action Tag

- `TRAINING EXERCISE START STEP <step_number> <action>`
- `TRAINING EXERCISE STOP STEP <step_number>`

When `<step_number>` is **greater than** the wanted step number, **remove** inside content.

When `<step_number>` is **equal to** the wanted step number:
* **remove** inside content from **exercise**;
* **keep** inside content into **solution**.

When `<step_number>` is **smaller than** the wanted step number, **execute `<action>`** on inside content.

Available actions:
* `KEEP` (default)
* `COMMENT`
* `REMOVE`

#### Threshold Conditioned Afterward Action Tag

- `TRAINING EXERCISE START STEP <step_number> <action_b> UNTIL <threshold_step_number> THEN <action_a>`
- `TRAINING EXERCISE STOP STEP <step_number>`

When `<step_number>` is **greater than** the wanted step number, **remove** inside content.

When `<step_number>` is **equal to** the wanted step number:
* **remove** inside content from **exercise**;
* **keep** inside content into **solution**.

When `<step_number>` is **smaller than** the wanted step number, **execute** one action:
* When `<threshold_step_number>` is **greater than or equal to** the wanted step number, **execute `<action_b>`**;
* When `<threshold_step_number>` is **smaller than** the wanted step number, **execute `<action_a>`**.

`<threshold_step_number>` must be greater than `<step_number>`.

#### Intro Keyword

Previous tags can contain keyword `INTRO` anywhere after their step number.

- `TRAINING EXERCISE STOP STEP <step_number> INTRO [...]`

With `INTRO`, when `<step_number>` is **equal to** the wanted step number, **keep** inside content in both **exercise and solution**.

#### Placeholder Tag

- `TRAINING EXERCISE STEP PLACEHOLDER`

When `<step_number>` is **equal to** the wanted step number:
* **keep** line containing this tag into **exercise** with this tag removed
* **remove** line containing this tag from **solution

#### Examples

Notes:
- See [examples/](examples) folder and *[About/Run Examples](#run-examples)* section for more.
- [tests/ExerciseCleanerTest.php](tests/ExerciseCleanerTest.php) also contains some (harder to read) usage examples

        ->setHelp("Step 1 feature\nStep 2 feature");
}
```

### Command

`./exercise-cleaner.phar [--keep-orig] [--keep-tag] <step> [folder [folder...]]`

Options:
* `--help`: Display usage help
* `--input-ext`: Treat only file having this extension and remove this extension before saving.
* `--output-ext`: Instead of replacing content in file, write a new file with extension .step<step_number>.<exercise|solution>.
* `--keep-tag`: Do not remove tags
* `--solution`: Compile exercise's solution (by default, it compile the exercise's worksheet)
* `--config YAML_CONFIG_FILE`: associate a config file
* `-v`: Display information about treated files
* `-vv`: Also display information about found tags
* `--quiet`: Do not display information about steps

Arguments:
* first argument: step number: clean inside this and higher tags; By default, step 1
* following arguments: folder to search in; By default, it looks inside app/ and src/

#### File Extensions

* `./exercise-cleaner.phar 1 example.php;` will clean for first step's exercise and **replace _example.php_**
* `./exercise-cleaner.phar 1 example.php --output-ext;` will clean _example.php_ for first step's exercise and **save into file _example.php.step1.exercise_**
* `./exercise-cleaner.phar 1 example.php.ec --input-ext ec;` will clean _example.php.ec_ for first step's exercise and **save into _example.php_**
* `./exercise-cleaner.phar 1 example.php.ec --input-ext ec --output-ext;` will clean _example.php.ec_ for first step's exercise and **save into _example.php.step1.exercise_**

Using an extension can prevent the application to consider unstable files. When using an extension, some file associations could be added to IDE; like, for example, *.php.ec â†’ PHP.

To migrate from a no-extension to an extension structure, for example with `ec` extension:
- `grep 'TRAINING EXERCISE START STEP' -Rl examples/ | xargs -I {} mv -v {} {}.ec;`

To migrate from an extension to a no-extension structure, for example with `ec` extension, you can use one of this:
- `grep 'TRAINING EXERCISE START STEP' -Rl examples/ | xargs -I {} mv -v {}.ec {};`
- `find examples/ -name *.ec | while read file; do mv -v $file ${file%.ec}; done;`

In those migration examples, `git mv` may be used instead of `mv`.

### Config File

#### Step Naming

Step naming enhances output.

##### Examples

Using floats:
```yaml
steps:
    names:
        - { number: 1.1, name: 'First Step: First Part' }
        - { n: 1.2, name: 'First Step: Second Part' }
        - { n: 2, name: 'Second Step' }
```
Note: `n` is a shorthand for `number`, they are strictly equivalents.

Using only integers:
```yaml
steps:
    names:
        - 'First Step'
        - 'Second Step'
```
Note: If floats are finally used, a conversion to object list will be needed; So, using the previous format even if there is only integers could be recommended.

#### File Extension

Instead of using each time `--input-ext` with the command, the input file extension can be declared in config file.

##### Examples

The following sequence already using a config file to name steps can be simplified:
```shell
./exercise-cleaner.phar --config exercise-cleaner.yml --input-ext ec 1 examples/;
./exercise-cleaner.phar --config exercise-cleaner.yml --input-ext ec 1 examples/ --solution;
./exercise-cleaner.phar --config exercise-cleaner.yml --input-ext ec 2 examples/;
./exercise-cleaner.phar --config exercise-cleaner.yml --input-ext ec 2 examples/ --solution;
```

Using the following config file:
```yaml
steps:
    names:
        - 'First Step'
        - 'Second Step'

files:
    input:
        extension: 'ec'
```
```shell
./exercise-cleaner.phar --config exercise-cleaner.yml 1 examples/;
./exercise-cleaner.phar --config exercise-cleaner.yml 1 examples/ --solution;
./exercise-cleaner.phar --config exercise-cleaner.yml 2 examples/;
./exercise-cleaner.phar --config exercise-cleaner.yml 2 examples/ --solution;
```

About
-----

### Compile Phar

```shell
php -d phar.readonly=Off compile-phar.php;
./exercise-cleaner.phar --version;
```

Note: When a release is created, an asset is automatically compiled and attached to it (see [*Release Asset* workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml))

### Run Unit Tests

Note: A `composer install --dev` (or alike) must have been previously executed.

`./vendor/bin/phpunit --colors tests;`

Note: When a push to `develop` branch, to `master` branch or to a pull request targeting one of this two branches is done, tests are automatically run (see [*PHP Composer* workflow](.github/workflows/php.yml))

### Run Examples

Treat examples with the source code (without compiling):
```shell
find examples -name *.step*.exercise -o -name *.step*.solution | xargs rm -f; # Clean previous runs
for step in 1 1.1 1.2 2 3; do
    php src/Application.php --keep-orig $step examples/;
    php src/Application.php --keep-orig --solution $step examples/;
done;
```

Treat examples after compiling and with verbosity:
```shell
php -d phar.readonly=0 compile-phar.php;
./exercise-cleaner.phar --version;
rm -f examples/*.step*.*; # Clean previous runs
for step in 1 1.1 1.2 2 3; do
    ./exercise-cleaner.phar --config examples/config2.yaml --verbose --keep-orig $step examples;
    ./exercise-cleaner.phar --config examples/config2.yaml --verbose --keep-orig --solution $step examples;
done;
```

Treat shell example and execute the result:
```shell
for step in 1 1.1 1.2 2 3; do
    echo "\nSTEP $step EXERCISE";
    php src/Application.php $step examples/example.sh;
    zsh examples/example.sh;
    git checkout -- examples/example.sh;
    echo "\nSTEP $step SOLUTION";
    php src/Application.php --solution $step examples/example.sh;
    zsh examples/example.sh;
    git checkout -- examples/example.sh;
done;
```

### TODO

* Version string as step numbers
* Find a better mechanism and wording for `INTRO` and `PLACEHOLDER` (more understandable, more consistent)
* Handle just `TRAINING EXERCISE START STEP <step_number> <action_b> UNTIL <threshold_step_number>` (with default/implicit `THEN REMOVE`)
* Handle just `TRAINING EXERCISE START STEP <step_number> UNTIL <threshold_step_number>` (with default/implicit `KEEP UNTIL <n> THEN REMOVE`)
* More unit tests
* Test with / Update for eZ Platform v3
* How to easily distribute the .phar?
* Define a license (at least in the [composer.json](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#license))
* Stop writing "exercise" with two 'c'
